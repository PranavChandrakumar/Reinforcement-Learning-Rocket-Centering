# Reinforcement Learning Rocket Centering
A deterministic physics simulation (dependent on initial parameters) that uses reinforcement learning via genetic programming.

An initial velocity and position is provided to a rocket, and the program subsequently determines an optimal thrust application in order to get the rocket to reach a certain position, and attain a zero velocity at that position.
